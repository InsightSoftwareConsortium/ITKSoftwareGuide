This example illustrates the use of Mathematical Morphology filters for
image enhancement. One of the difficulties of image enhancement is that
it is defined based on human visual perception and it is related to a
particular set of features that are of interest in the image. In this
context, what is considered enhancement for one person, may be seen as
image degradation by another person.
