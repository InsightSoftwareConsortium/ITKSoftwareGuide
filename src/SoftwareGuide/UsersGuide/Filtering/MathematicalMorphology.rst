{sec:MathematicalMorphology}

Mathematical morphology has proved to be a powerful resource for image
processing and analysis . ITK implements mathematical morphology filters
using NeighborhoodIterators and {NeighborhoodOperator}s. The toolkit
contains two types of image morphology algorithms, filters that operate
on binary images and filters that operate on grayscale images.
