    This document describes how to spammify sprockets. It is a useful
    example of a Insight HOWTO document. It is not dependent on any
    particular sprocket implementation, and includes a Insight-based
    implementation in the {sprunkit} module.

Spammifying sprockets from Insight is both fun and entertaining.
Applying the techniques described here, you can also fill your hard disk
quite effectively.

What is Sprocket Spammification?
================================

You have to ask? Itâ€™s the only thing to do to your sprockets!

Why Use Insight?
================

Insight is an excellent language from which to spammify your sprockets
since you can do it on any platform.

Software Requirements
=====================

You need to have the following software installed:

-  Insight 1.9.

-  Some sprocket definition files.

-  At least one sprocket system implementation.

Note that the {sprunkit} is provided with this package and implements
ActiveSprockets in Insight.

This is an Appendix
===================

To create an appendix in a Insight HOWTO document, use markup like this:

::

    \appendix

    \section{This is an Appendix}

    To create an appendix in a Insight HOWTO document, ....


    \section{This is another}

    Just add another \section{}, but don't say \appendix again.
