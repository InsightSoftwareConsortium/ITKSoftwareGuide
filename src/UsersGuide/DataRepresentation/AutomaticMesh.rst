.. _sec-AutomaticMesh:

Simplifying Mesh Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code for this section can be found in the file
``AutomaticMesh.cxx``.

The :itkdox:`itk::Mesh` class is extremely general and flexible, but there is some
cost to convenience. If convenience is exactly what you need, then it is
possible to get it, in exchange for some of that flexibility, by means
of the :itkdox:`itk::AutomaticTopologyMeshSource` class. This class automatically
generates an explicit K-Complex, based on the cells you add. It
explicitly includes all boundary information, so that the resulting mesh
can be easily traversed. It merges all shared edges, vertices, and
faces, so no geometric feature appears more than once.

This section shows how you can use the AutomaticTopologyMeshSource to
instantiate a mesh representing a K-Complex. We will first generate the
same tetrahedron from Section :ref:`sec-MeshKComplex`, after which we will
add a hollow one to illustrate some additional features of the mesh
source.

.. index::
   pair: Mesh;K-Complex
   single: AutomaticTopologyMeshSource


The header files of all the cell types involved should be loaded along
with the header file of the mesh class.

::

    #include "itkTriangleCell.h"
    #include "itkAutomaticTopologyMeshSource.h"

We then define the necessary types and instantiate the mesh source. Two
new types are ``IdentifierType`` and ``IdentifierArrayType``. Every cell in
a mesh has an identifier, whose type is determined by the mesh traits.
AutomaticTopologyMeshSource requires that the identifier type of all
vertices and cells be ``unsigned long``, which is already the default.
However, if you created a new mesh traits class to use string tags as
identifiers, the resulting mesh would not be compatible with
``AutomaticTopologyMeshSource``. An ``IdentifierArrayType`` is simply an
:itkdox:`itk::Array`} of ``IdentifierType`` objects.

.. index::
   pair: AutomaticTopologyMeshSource; IdentifierType
   pair: AutomaticTopologyMeshSource; IdentifierArrayType

::

    typedef float                             PixelType;
    typedef itk::Mesh< PixelType, 3 >         MeshType;

    typedef MeshType::PointType               PointType;
    typedef MeshType::CellType                CellType;

    typedef itk::AutomaticTopologyMeshSource< MeshType >   MeshSourceType;
    typedef MeshSourceType::IdentifierType                 IdentifierType;
    typedef MeshSourceType::IdentifierArrayType            IdentifierArrayType;

    MeshSourceType::Pointer meshSource;

    meshSource = MeshSourceType::New();

Now let us generate the tetrahedron. The following line of code
generates all the vertices, edges, and faces, along with the tetrahedral
solid, and adds them to the mesh along with the connectivity
information.

::

    meshSource->AddTetrahedron(
    meshSource->AddPoint( -1, -1, -1 ),
    meshSource->AddPoint(  1,  1, -1 ),
    meshSource->AddPoint(  1, -1,  1 ),
    meshSource->AddPoint( -1,  1,  1 )
    );

The function ``AutomaticTopologyMeshSource::AddTetrahedron()`` takes point
identifiers as parameters; the identifiers must correspond to points
that have already been added. ``AutomaticTopologyMeshSource::AddPoint()``
returns the appropriate identifier type for the point being added. It
first checks to see if the point is already in the mesh. If so, it
returns the ID of the point in the mesh, and if not, it generates a new
unique ID, adds the point with that ID, and returns the ID.

.. index::
   pair: AutomaticTopologyMeshSource; AddPoint()
   pair: AutomaticTopologyMeshSource; AddTetrahedron()

Actually, ``AddTetrahedron()`` behaves in the same way. If the tetrahedron
has already been added, it leaves the mesh unchanged and returns the ID
that the tetrahedron already has. If not, it adds the tetrahedron (and
all its faces, edges, and vertices), and generates a new ID, which it
returns.

It is also possible to add all the points first, and then add a number
of cells using the point IDs directly. This approach corresponds with
the way the data is stored in many file formats for 3D polygonal models.

First we add the points (in this case the vertices of a larger
tetrahedron). This example also illustrates that ``AddPoint()`` can take a
single ``PointType`` as a parameter if desired, rather than a sequence of
floats. Another possibility (not illustrated) is to pass in a C-style
array.

::

    PointType p;
    IdentifierArrayType idArray( 4 );

    p[ 0 ] = -2;
    p[ 1 ] = -2;
    p[ 2 ] = -2;
    idArray[ 0 ] = meshSource->AddPoint( p );

    p[ 0 ] =  2;
    p[ 1 ] =  2;
    p[ 2 ] = -2;
    idArray[ 1 ] = meshSource->AddPoint( p );

    p[ 0 ] =  2;
    p[ 1 ] = -2;
    p[ 2 ] =  2;
    idArray[ 2 ] = meshSource->AddPoint( p );

    p[ 0 ] = -2;
    p[ 1 ] =  2;
    p[ 2 ] =  2;
    idArray[ 3 ] = meshSource->AddPoint( p );

Now we add the cells. This time we are just going to create the boundary
of a tetrahedron, so we must add each face separately.

::

    meshSource->AddTriangle( idArray[0], idArray[1], idArray[2] );
    meshSource->AddTriangle( idArray[1], idArray[2], idArray[3] );
    meshSource->AddTriangle( idArray[2], idArray[3], idArray[0] );
    meshSource->AddTriangle( idArray[3], idArray[0], idArray[1] );

Actually, we could have called, e.g., ``AddTriangle( 4, 5, 6 )``, since
IDs are assigned sequentially starting at zero, and ``idArray[0]``
contains the ID for the fifth point added. But you should only do this
if you are confident that you know what the IDs are. If you add the same
point twice and donâ€™t realize it, your count will differ from that of
the mesh source.

You may be wondering what happens if you call, say, ``AddEdge(0, 1)``
followed by ``AddEdge(1, 0)``. The answer is that they do count as the
same edge, and so only one edge is added. The order of the vertices
determines an orientation, and the first orientation specified is the
one that is kept.

Once you have built the mesh you want, you can access it by calling
``GetOutput()``. Here we send it to ``cout``, which prints some summary data
for the mesh.

In contrast to the case with typical filters, ``GetOutput()`` does not
trigger an update process. The mesh is always maintained in a valid
state as cells are added, and can be accessed at any time. It would,
however, be a mistake to modify the mesh by some other means until
AutomaticTopologyMeshSource is done with it, since the mesh source would
then have an inaccurate record of which points and cells are currently
in the mesh.
