Contribute with Git
===================

Modifying an existing example
-----------------------------

First, create a local branch::

  git checkout -b Modification


Modify existing example (source code and/or corresponding documentation).
Add files which are missing ::

  git add missing_files


Once you are done, commit your changes as follows::

  git commit -a


Merge your changes onto master, and push your changes to the main repository ::

  git checkout master
  git pull origin master
  git merge --no-ff Modification
  git branch -d Modification


Create a new example
--------------------

To create a new example, you can make use of the python script located in the binary tree
(/path/to/ITKExamples-build/utilities) ::

  cd /path/to/ITKExamples-build/utilities
  ./CreateNewExample.py /path/to/source/ITK

This script will generate cxx and rst files to be modified.
Note that the generated files are then located based on the group, module and class name to be demonstrated.
For instance an example which would demonstrate the usage of itk::Image will be located in src/Examples/Core/Common/.
