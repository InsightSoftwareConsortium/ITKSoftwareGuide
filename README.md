ITK Software Guide
==================

[![Build](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKSoftwareGuide/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](
https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKSoftwareGuide/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild+branch%3Amaster)

This [ITK Software Guide] is the handbook for developing software with ITK.

It is divided into two companion books.

The [first book] covers
building and installation, general architecture and design, as well as the
process of contributing in the ITK community.

The [second book] covers
detailed design and functionality for reading and writing images, filtering,
registration, segmentation, and performing statistical analysis.

This repository contains the source code for the Software Guide.

Contribution Details
--------------------

For more detailed instructions, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

Building with Docker
--------------------

All the dependencies described below are available pre-installed in a [Docker]
image. This is the easiest way to build and contribute to The Software
Guide.

  1. Download and [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
  2. From a shell, run
```sh
docker run --name software-guide -p 8888:8888 insighttoolkit/itksoftwareguide-edit:latest
```
  3. Open the URL provided in the ternmial output in a web browser. In the web interface, open a Terminal
  4. To setup the repository for develop and build the project, run:
```sh
ssh-keygen
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Paste this value into https://github.com/settings/keys
cd /ITKSoftwareGuide
./Utilities/SetupForDevelopment.sh
cd /ITKSoftwareGuide-build/ITKSoftwareGuide-build
ninja
```
  6. To view the built PDF's, navigate to `/ITKSoftwareGuide-build/ITKSoftwareGuide-build/SoftwareGuide/Latex/`,
     and double click on the PDF.
  7. Contribute as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
  8. To restart the container, run `docker start software-guide`.

Build Overview
--------------

A combination of [CMake]
`Superbuild` infrastructure, [Python] extraction scripts, and [LaTeX]
formatting are required to render the entire ITK Software Guide.

`CMakeLists.txt` files are placed in the directories
involved on the build process. As any other CMake-managed process, the results
of the build process are put in a binary tree corresponding to the source tree.

The following dependencies are required to build ITK Software Guide on Linux or
Windows platforms:

  * [Git]
  * [Python]
  * [ImageMagick]: Windows installer can be found
    [here](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows).
  * [LaTeX] and [BibTeX]. See the preamble of the
    [`./SoftwareGuide/Latex/00-Preamble-Common.tex`] file for the full list of
    required LaTeX packages. Among these packages, the [Minted] package for
    syntax highlighting in its turn depends on a Python package [Pygments].
    Instructions for installing [Minted] and [Pygments] packages on Windows are
    available [here](https://minted.googlecode.com/files/minted.pdf).
  * [dvips], [ps2pdf]. While on Linux platforms these tools are usually
    included with most distributions, on Windows platforms they are usually
    included in [MikTex] Latex distribution.

ITK Software Guide is generated with Latex by using input from a variety of
source code files and images:

  1. LaTeX files found in [`./SoftwareGuide/Latex`].
  2. JPEG, PNG and EPS files in [`./SoftwareGuide/Art`].
  3. PNG files generated as the result of compiling and running the examples
     included in the ITK source code.
  3. ITK examples source code `.cxx` files where the comments delimited with
     `BeginLaTeX`, `EndLaTeX` and `BeginCodeSnippet`, `EndCodeSnippet` have
     been written specifically to be included in the ITK Software Guide; the
     regular LaTeX files in [`./SoftwareGuide/Latex`] include the LaTeX files
     generated from the ITK examples source code.

Following is a brief description of the build process:

  1. The source code of `ITK` is downloaded and built (including ITK
     examples) in the binary output directory.
  2. JPEG and PNG files in the [`./SoftwareGuide/Art`] directory are converted
     to EPS using [ImageMagick] tools; the resulting EPS files are saved in the
     `Art` directory in the binary output directory.
  3. PNG files are generated by running ITK examples and converted to EPS using
     [ImageMagick]; the resulting EPS files are saved in `Art/Generated`
     directory of the binary output directory.
  4. A Python script
     [`./SoftwareGuide/Examples/ParseCxxExamples.py`](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKSoftwareGuide/blob/master/SoftwareGuide/Examples/ParseCxxExamples.py)
     is invoked to extract the comments in the ITK examples source file
     delimited with `BeginLaTeX`, `EndLaTeX` and `BeginCodeSnippet`,
     `EndCodeSnippet` and generate LaTeX files which are copied into the
     `Examples` subdirectory of the binary output directory.
  5. The top-level LaTeX file
     [`./SoftwareGuide/LaTeX/ITKSoftwareGuide-Book1.tex`](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKSoftwareGuide/blob/master/SoftwareGuide/Latex/ITKSoftwareGuide-Book1.tex)
     is compiled with a series of calls to `latex`, `bibtex`, `latex`,
     `makeindex`,`dvips`, and `ps2pdf` to generate the PDF file.

Configuring and Building with CMake
-----------------------------------

Following is the description how to configure and build ITK Software Guide using
[CMake]:

  1. Run cmake-gui and specify input and binary output directories.
     Alternatively, create the binary output directory and run
```sh
   $ ccmake source_dir
```
where source_dir is the full path of the `ITKSoftwareGuide` directory.
  2. Configure and generate the project for the target platform.
  3. Build `SuperBuild\_ITKSoftwareGuide` project as appropriate for the target
     platform.

Troubleshooting
---------------

  1. Build process will fail if [CMake] is unable to locate any of the
     dependencies. In this case a close examination of the error messages might
     provide a clue as to which dependency is failing.

  2. Frustrated by the build taking a long time to complete
     ... no solution here :blush:.
