Style Guidelines for the ITK Software Guide
===========================================

1. Make sure code is formatted according to ITK style guidelines; especially
   note the use of brackets `{}` and two-space indentation:

```cpp
   for ()
     {
     yabba++;
     dabba++;
     do++;
     }
```

2. `\doxygen{}` - The first occurrence of a class in a section should use this
   (or for those in sub-name spaces like `itk::Statistics::`) use
   `\subdoxygen{}`.

   Subsequent references to the class name should just use plain text (do not
   use `\code{}` or `\doxygen{}`). This is for readibility (too much font
   changing drives the reader nuts).

3. `\code{}` - Method names (which should have a trailing `()`, e.g.,
   `SetSigma()`); reserved C++ words (`for`, `while`, `switch`, etc.); simple
   types (`char`, `unsigned char`, `float`, etc.); and other content found in
   the ITK source code.

4. Section Naming - Use upper case for most words with the exception of
   articles and prepositions (e.g., *The Holy Iterator and ITK*).

5. Begin Latex sections in code with:
```cpp
  // Software Guide : BeginLatex
  //
  include the extra blank line with //, it makes formatting easier. End with
  //
  // Software Guide : EndLatex
```

6. Include code snippets in code with:
```cpp
  // Software Guide : BeginCodeSnippet
  // Software Guide : EndCodeSnippet
```
  Anything inside these gets put into the document; avoid blank lines or too
  much whitespace. Make sure any comments in included code are correct in
  terms of grammar, spelling, and are complete sentences.
  Note that **the code should not exceed 79 columns** or it will go out of
  margins in the PDF document.

7. Figure/table captions should be proper sentences and end in a period
   `.`.

8. Specific proper nouns like `Figure 1` or `Table 2` should be capitalized. A
   general, non-specific noun (*referring to the figure above*) should not
   be capitalized. Try to use the `~` symbol to connect `Figure~\ref{}` to
   avoid bad page breaks.

9. Don't forget to index. You may need hyphenation directives in long
   class/method names, etc.
   Avoid the use of the `{textbf}` at the end of the index. It looks nice on
   the printed version but breaks the hyperlinks in the PDF online version.

10. When possible, a short paragraph on motivation/theory prior to an example
    is good. It's not a theory book, so balance the amount of material
    carefully.
