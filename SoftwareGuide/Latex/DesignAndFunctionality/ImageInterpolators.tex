\end{floatingfigure}

In the registration process, the metric typically compares intensity values
in the fixed image against the corresponding values in the transformed moving
image. When a point is mapped from one space to another by a transform, it
will in general be mapped to a non-grid position. Therefore, interpolation is
required to evaluate the image intensity at the mapped position.

Figure \ref{fig:ImageOverlapIterator} (left) illustrates the mapping of the
fixed image space onto the moving image space. The transform maps points from
the fixed image coordinate system onto the moving image coordinate system. The
figure highlights the region of overlap between the two images after the
mapping. The right side illustrates how an iterator is used to walk through a
region of the fixed image. Each one of the iterator positions is mapped by the
transform onto the moving image space in order to find the homologous pixel.

Figure \ref{fig:ImageOverlapInterpolator} presents a detailed view of the
mapping from the fixed image to the moving image. In general, the grid
positions of the fixed image will not be mapped onto grid positions of the
moving image.  Interpolation is needed for estimating the intensity of the
moving image at these non-grid positions. The service is provided in ITK by
interpolator classes that can be plugged into the registration method.

The following interpolators are available:

\begin{itemize}
\item \doxygen{NearestNeighborInterpolateImageFunction}
\item \doxygen{LinearInterpolateImageFunction}
\item \doxygen{BSplineInterpolateImageFunction}
\item \doxygen{WindowedSincInterpolateImageFunction}
\end{itemize}

In the context of registration, the interpolation method affects the smoothness
of the optimization search space and the overall computation time. On the other
hand, interpolations are executed thousands of times in a single optimization
cycle. Hence, the user has to balance the simplicity of computation with the
smoothness of the optimization when selecting the interpolation scheme.

\index{itk::InterpolateImageFunction!Evaluate()}
\index{itk::InterpolateImageFunction!EvaluateAtContinuousIndex()}
\index{itk::InterpolateImageFunction!IsInsideBuffer()}

The basic input to an \doxygen{InterpolateImageFunction} is the image to
be interpolated. Once an image has been defined using \code{SetInputImage()},
a user can interpolate either at a point using \code{Evaluate()} or
an index using \code{EvaluateAtContinuousIndex()}.

Interpolators provide the method \code{IsInsideBuffer()} that tests whether a
particular image index or a physical point falls inside the spatial domain for
which image pixels exist.

\subsection{Nearest Neighbor Interpolation}
\label{sec:NearestNeighborInterpolation}
\index{itk::Nearest\-Neighbor\-Interpolate\-Image\-Function}
The \doxygen{NearestNeighborInterpolateImageFunction} simply uses the
intensity of the nearest grid position. That is, it assumes that the image
intensity is piecewise constant with jumps mid-way between grid positions.
This interpolation scheme is cheap as it does not require any floating point
computations.


\subsection{Linear Interpolation}
\label{sec:LinearInterpolation}
\index{itk::Linear\-Interpolate\-Image\-Function}

The \doxygen{LinearInterpolateImageFunction} assumes that intensity varies
linearly between grid positions. Unlike nearest neighbor interpolation, the
interpolated intensity is spatially continuous. However, the intensity
gradient will be discontinuous at grid positions.


\subsection{B-Spline Interpolation}
\label{sec:BSplineInterpolation}
\index{itk::BSpline\-Interpolate\-Image\-Function}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{BSplineInterpolation.eps}
\itkcaption[BSpline Interpolation Concepts]{The left side illustrates the
BSpline grid and the deformations that are known on those nodes. The right side
illustrates the region where interpolation is possible when the BSpline is of
cubic order. The small arrows represent deformation values that were
interpolated from the grid deformations shown on the left side of the diagram.}
\label{fig:BSplineInterpolation}
\end{figure}


The \doxygen{BSplineInterpolateImageFunction} represents the image intensity
using B-spline basis functions. When an input image is first connected to the
interpolator, B-spline coefficients are computed using recursive filtering
(assuming mirror boundary conditions). Intensity at a non-grid position is
computed by multiplying the B-spline coefficients with shifted B-spline kernels
within a small support region of the requested position.
Figure~\ref{fig:BSplineInterpolation} illustrates on the left how the
deformation values on the BSpline grid nodes are used for computing
interpolated deformations in the rest of space. Note for example that when a
cubic BSpline is used, the grid must have one extra node in one side of the
image and two extra nodes on the other side, this along every dimension.

Currently, this interpolator supports splines of order $0$ to $5$. Using a
spline of order $0$ is almost identical to nearest neighbor interpolation; a
spline of order $1$ is exactly identical to linear interpolation. For splines
of order greater than $1$, both the interpolated value and its derivative are
spatially continuous.

It is important to note that when using this scheme, the interpolated
value may lie outside the range of input image intensities. This is
especially important when handling unsigned data, as it is possible
that the interpolated value is negative.


\subsection{Windowed Sinc Interpolation}
\label{sec:WindowedSincInterpolation}
\index{itk::Windowed\-Sinc\-Interpolate\-Image\-Function}

The \doxygen{WindowedSincInterpolateImageFunction} is the best possible
interpolator for data that have been digitized in a discrete grid. This
interpolator has been developed based on Fourier Analysis considerations. It
is well known in signal processing that the process of sampling a spatial
function using a periodic discrete grid results in a replication of the
spectrum of that signal in the frequency domain.

The process of recovering the continuous signal from the discrete sampling is
equivalent to the removal of the replicated spectra in the frequency domain.
This can be done by multiplying the spectra with a box function that will set
to zero all the frequencies above the highest frequency in the original signal.
Multiplying the spectrum with a box function is equivalent to convolving the
spatial discrete signal with a sinc function

\begin{equation}
sinc(x) = \sin{(x)} / x
\end{equation}

The sinc function has infinite support, which of course in practice can not
really be implemented. Therefore, the sinc is usually truncated by multiplying
it with a Window function. The Windowed Sinc interpolator is the result of such an
operation.

This interpolator presents a series of trade-offs in its utilization. Probably
the most significant is that the larger the window, the more precise will be
the resulting interpolation. However, large windows will also result in long
computation times. Since the user can select the window size in this
interpolator, it is up to the user to determine how much interpolation quality
is required in her/his application and how much computation time can be
justified. For details on the signal processing theory behind this
interpolator, please refer to Meijering \emph{et.
al}~\cite{SignalReconstruction}.

The region of the image used for computing the interpolator is determined by
the window \emph{radius}. For example, in a $2D$ image where we want to
interpolate the value at position $(x,y)$ the following computation will be
performed.

\begin{equation}
I(x,y) =
\sum_{i = \lfloor x \rfloor + 1 - m}^{\lfloor x \rfloor + m}
\sum_{j = \lfloor y \rfloor + 1 - m}^{\lfloor y \rfloor + m}
I_{i,j} K(x-i) K(y-j)
\end{equation}

where $m$ is the \emph{radius} of the window. Typically, values such as 3 or 4
are reasonable for the window radius. The function kernel $K(t)$ is composed by
the $sinc$ function and one of the windows listed above.

\begin{equation}
K(t) = w(t) \textrm{sinc}(t) = w(t) \frac{\sin(\pi t)}{\pi t}
\end{equation}

Some of the windows that can be used with this interpolator are

Cosinus window
\begin{equation}
w(x) = cos ( \frac{\pi x}{2 m} )
\end{equation}


Hamming window
\begin{equation}
w(x) = 0.54 + 0.46 cos ( \frac{\pi x}{m} )
\end{equation}


Welch window
\begin{equation}
w(x) = 1 - ( \frac{x^2}{m^2} )
\end{equation}


Lancos window
\begin{equation}
w(x) = \textrm{sinc} ( \frac{x}{m} )
\end{equation}


Blackman window
\begin{equation}
w(x) = 0.42 + 0.5 cos(\frac{\pi x}{m}) + 0.08 cos(\frac{2 \pi x}{m})
\end{equation}


The window functions listed above are available inside the itk::Function
namespace. The conclusions of the referenced paper suggest to use the Welch,
Cosine, Kaiser, and Lancos windows for m = 4,5. These are based on error in
rotating medical images with respect to the linear interpolation method. In
some cases the results achieve a 20-fold improvement in accuracy.

This filter can be used in the same way you would use any
ImageInterpolationFunction. For instance, you can plug it into the
ResampleImageFilter class.  In order to instantiate the filter you must choose
several template parameters.

\code{TInputImage} is the image type, as for any other interpolator.

\code{VRadius} is the radius of the kernel, i.e., the $m$ from the
formula above.

\code{TWindowFunction} is the window function object, which you can choose from
about five different functions defined in this header. The default is the
Hamming window, which is commonly used but not optimal according to the cited
paper.

\code{TBoundaryCondition} is the boundary condition class used to determine the
values of pixels that fall off the image boundary. This class has the same
meaning here as in the \doxygen{NeighborhoodIterator} classes.

\code{TCoordRep} is again standard for interpolating functions, and should be
float or double.


The WindowedSincInterpolateImageFunction is probably not the interpolator that
you want to use for performing registration. Its computation burden makes it
too expensive for this purpose. The best use of this interpolator is for the
final resampling of the image, once the transform has been found using
another less expensive interpolator in the registration process.
