\index{Vector!Geometrical Concept}

In the Insight Toolkit, \doxygen{Transform} objects encapsulate the mapping of
points and vectors from an input space to an output space.  If a transform is
invertible, back transform methods are also provided.  Currently, ITK provides
a variety of transforms from simple translation, rotation and scaling to
general affine and kernel transforms.  Note that, while in this section we
discuss transforms in the context of registration, transforms are general and
can be used for other applications. Some of the most commonly used transforms
will be discussed in detail later. Let's begin by introducing the objects used
in ITK for representing basic spatial concepts.


\subsection{Geometrical Representation}

\end{figure}

ITK implements a consistent geometric representation of space. The
characteristics of classes involved in this representation are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:GeometricalConcepts}. In this regard, ITK takes full advantage
of the capabilities of Object Oriented programming and resists the temptation
of using simple arrays of \code{float} or \code{double} in order to represent
geometrical objects. The use of basic arrays would have blurred the important
distinction between the different geometrical concepts and would have allowed
for the innumerable conceptual and programming errors that result from using a
vector where a point is needed or vice versa.

Relative position between two points. In $N$-dimensional space it is
represented by an array of $N$ numbers, each one associated with the distance
along a coordinate axis. Vectors do not have a position in space. A vector is
defined as the subtraction of two points.\\

\doxygen{CovariantVector} & Orthogonal direction to a $(N-1)$-dimensional
manifold in space. For example, in $3D$ it corresponds to the vector orthogonal
to a surface. This is the appropriate class for representing gradients of

should not be added to Points, nor to Vectors.\\

\end{table}


Additional uses of the \doxygen{Point}, \doxygen{Vector} and
\doxygen{CovariantVector} classes have been discussed in the Data
Representation chapter of Book 1.  Each one of these classes behaves
differently under spatial transformations. It is therefore quite important to
keep their distinction clear. Figure \ref{fig:GeometricalObjects} illustrates
the differences between these concepts.


\index{itk::Transform!TransformPoint()}
\index{itk::Transform!TransformVector()}
\index{itk::Transform!TransformCovariantVector()}

Transform classes provide different methods for mapping each one of
the basic space-representation objects.  Points, vectors and covariant vectors
are transformed using the methods \code{TransformPoint()},
\code{TransformVector()} and \code{TransformCovariantVector()} respectively.

One of the classes that deserves further comments is the \doxygen{Vector}. This
ITK class tends to be misinterpreted as a container of elements instead of a
geometrical object. This is a common misconception originating from the colloquial
use by computer scientists and software engineers of the term ``Vector''.  The
actual word ``Vector'' is relatively young. It was coined by William Hamilton
in his book ``\emph{Elements of Quaternions}'' published in 1886
(post-mortem)\cite{Hamilton1866}.  In the same text Hamilton coined the terms:
``\emph{Scalar}'', ``\emph{Versor}'' and ``\emph{Tensor}''.  Although the
modern term of ``\emph{Tensor}'' is used in Calculus in a different sense of
what Hamilton defined in his book at the time~\cite{Dodson1997}.

A ``\emph{Vector}'' is, by definition, a mathematical object that embodies the
concept of ``direction in space''. Strictly speaking, a Vector describes the
relationship between two Points in space, and captures both their relative
distance and orientation.

Computer scientists and software engineers misused the term vector in order to
represent the concept of an ``Indexed Set''~\cite{Austern1999}.  Mechanical
Engineers and Civil Engineers, who deal with the real world of physical objects
will not commit this mistake and will keep the word ``\emph{Vector}'' attached
to a geometrical concept.  Biologists, on the other hand, will associate
``\emph{Vector}'' to a ``vehicle'' that allows them to direct something in a
particular direction, for example, a virus that allows them to insert pieces of
code into a DNA strand~\cite{Lodish2000}.

Textbooks in programming do not help to clarify those concepts and loosely use
the term ``\emph{Vector}'' for the purpose of representing an ``enumerated set
of common elements''. STL follows this trend and continues using the word
``\emph{Vector}'' in this manner ~\cite{Austern1999,Alexandrescu2001}. Linear algebra separates the
``\emph{Vector}'' from its notion of geometric reality and makes it an
abstract set of numbers with arithmetic operations associated.

For those of you who are looking for the ``\emph{Vector}'' in the Software
Engineering sense, please look at the \doxygen{Array} and \doxygen{FixedArray}
classes that actually provide such functionalities. Additionally, the
\doxygen{VectorContainer} and \doxygen{MapContainer} classes may be of interest
too. These container classes are intended for algorithms which require insertion
and deletion of elements, and those which may have large numbers of elements.

The Insight Toolkit deals with real objects that inhabit the physical space.
This is particularly true in the context of the image registration framework.
We chose to give the appropriate name to the mathematical objects that describe
geometrical relationships in N-Dimensional space. It is for this reason that we
explicitly make clear the distinction between Point, Vector and CovariantVector,
despite the fact that most people would be happy with a simple use of
\code{double[3]} for the three concepts and then will proceed to perform all
sort of conceptually flawed operations such as

\begin{itemize}
\item Adding two Points
\item Dividing a Point by a Scalar
\item Adding a Covariant Vector to a Point
\item Adding a Covariant Vector to a Vector
\end{itemize}

In order to enforce the correct use of the geometrical concepts in ITK we
organized these classes in a hierarchy that supports reuse of code and
compartmentalizes the behavior of the individual classes.  The use of the
\doxygen{FixedArray} as the base class of the \doxygen{Point}, the \doxygen{Vector}
and the \doxygen{CovariantVector} was a design decision based on the decision to
use the correct nomenclature.

An \doxygen{FixedArray} is an enumerated collection with a fixed number of
elements. You can instantiate a fixed array of letters, or a fixed array of
images, or a fixed array of transforms, or a fixed array of geometrical shapes.
Therefore, the FixedArray only implements the functionality that is necessary to
access those enumerated elements. No assumptions can be made at this point on
any other operations required by the elements of the FixedArray, except that it
will have a default constructor.

The \doxygen{Point} is a type that represents the spatial coordinates of a
spatial location. Based on geometrical concepts we defined the valid operations
of the Point class. In particular we made sure that no \code{operator+()} was
defined between Points, and that no \code{operator*( scalar )} nor
\code{operator/( scalar )} were defined for Points.

In other words, you can perform ITK operations such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Vector  = Point - Point
\item Point  +=  Vector
\item Point  -=  Vector
\item Point  = BarycentricCombination( Point, Point )
\end{itemize}

and you cannot (because you \textbf{should not}) perform operations such as

\begin{itemize}
\item Point = Point * Scalar
\item Point = Point + Point
\item Point = Point / Scalar
\end{itemize}

The \doxygen{Vector} is, by Hamilton's definition, the subtraction between two
points. Therefore a Vector must satisfy the following basic operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Vector = Point - Point
\item Point  = Point + Vector
\item Point  = Point - Vector
\item Vector = Vector + Vector
\item Vector = Vector - Vector
\end{itemize}

An \doxygen{Vector} object is intended to be instantiated over elements that
support mathematical operation such as addition, subtraction and multiplication
by scalars.


\subsection{Transform General Properties}
\label{sec:TransformGeneralProperties}

\index{itk::Transform!SetParameters()} Each transform class typically has
several methods for setting its parameters.  For example,
\doxygen{Euler2DTransform} provides methods for specifying the offset,
angle, and the entire rotation matrix.  However, for use in the
registration framework, the parameters are represented by a flat
Array of doubles to facilitate communication with generic
optimizers. In the case of the Euler2DTransform, the transform is also
defined by three doubles: the first representing the angle, and the last two the
offset. The flat array of parameters is defined using \code{SetParameters()}. A
description of the parameters and their ordering is documented in the
sections that follow.

In the context of registration, the transform parameters define the search
space for optimizers. That is, the goal of the optimization is to find the set
of parameters defining a transform that results in the best possible value of
an image metric. The more parameters a transform has, the longer its
computational time will be when used in a registration method since the
dimension of the search space will be equal to the number of transform
parameters.

\index{itk::Transform!GetJacobian()}

Another requirement that the registration framework imposes on the transform
classes is the computation of their Jacobians. In general, metrics require
the knowledge of the Jacobian in order to compute Metric derivatives.
The Jacobian is a matrix whose elements are the partial derivatives of the
output point with respect to the array of parameters that defines the
transform:\footnote{Note that the term \emph{Jacobian} is also commonly used
for the matrix representing the derivatives of output point coordinates with
respect to input point coordinates. Sometimes the term is loosely used to
refer to the determinant of such a matrix.~\cite{Dodson1997}}

\begin{equation}
J=\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial p_{1}} &
\frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial p_{2}} &
\cdots  & \frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial p_{m}}\\
\frac{\partial x_{2}}{\partial p_{1}} &
\frac{\partial x_{2}}{\partial p_{2}} &
\cdots  & \frac{\partial x_{2}}{\partial p_{m}}\\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots  & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial x_{n}}{\partial p_{1}} &
\frac{\partial x_{n}}{\partial p_{2}} &
\cdots  & \frac{\partial x_{n}}{\partial p_{m}}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

where $\{p_i\}$ are the transform parameters and $\{x_i\}$ are the coordinates
of the output point.  Within this framework, the Jacobian is represented by an
\doxygen{Array2D} of doubles and is obtained from the transform by method
\code{GetJacobian()}. The Jacobian can be interpreted as a matrix that
indicates for a point in the input space how much its mapping on the output
space will change as a response to a small variation in one of the transform
parameters. Note that the values of the Jacobian matrix depend on the point in
the input space. So actually the Jacobian can be noted as $J(\bf{X})$, where
${\bf{X}}=\{x_i\}$. The use of transform Jacobians enables the efficient
computation of metric derivatives.  When Jacobians are not available, metrics
derivatives have to be computed using finite differences at a price of $2M$
evaluations of the metric value, where $M$ is the number of transform
parameters.

The following sections describe the main characteristics of the transform
classes available in ITK.

\subsection{Identity Transform}
\label{sec:IdentityTransform}

\end{center}
\itkcaption[Identity Transform Characteristics]{Characteristics of the identity transform.
\label{tab:IdentityTransformCharacteristics}}
\end{table}

The identity transform \doxygen{IdentityTransform} is mainly used for debugging
purposes. It is provided to methods that require a transform and in cases where
we want to have the certainty that the transform will have no effect whatsoever
in the outcome of the process. The main
characteristics of the identity transform are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:IdentityTransformCharacteristics}


\subsection{Translation Transform}
\label{sec:TranslationTransform}
\index{itk::TranslationTransform}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{1.8cm} | p{2.5cm} | p{4cm} |}
\hline
\textbf{Behavior} &
\textbf{Number of Parameters} &
\textbf{Parameter Ordering} &
\textbf{Restrictions} \\
\hline\hline
Represents a simple translation of points in the input space
and has no effect on vectors or covariant vectors. &
Same as the input space dimension. &
The $i$-th parameter represents the translation in the $i$-th dimension. &
Only defined when the input and output space have the same number of dimensions. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\itkcaption[Translation Transform Characteristics]{Characteristics of the TranslationTransform class.
\label{tab:TranslationTransformCharacteristics}}
\end{table}

The \doxygen{TranslationTransform} is probably the simplest yet one of the most
useful transformations.  It maps all Points by adding a Vector to them.  Vector
and covariant vectors remain unchanged under this transformation since they are
not associated with a particular position in space. Translation is the best
transform to use when starting a registration method. Before attempting to
solve for rotations or scaling it is important to overlap the anatomical
objects in both images as much as possible. This is done by resolving the
translational misalignment between the images. Translations also have the
advantage of being fast to compute and having parameters that are easy to
interpret. The main characteristics of the translation transform are presented
in Table~\ref{tab:TranslationTransformCharacteristics}.

\subsection{Scale Transform}
\label{sec:ScaleTransform}
\index{itk::ScaleTransform}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{1.8cm} | p{2.5cm} | p{4cm} |}
\hline
\textbf{Behavior} &
\textbf{Number of Parameters} &
\textbf{Parameter Ordering} &
\textbf{Restrictions} \\
\hline\hline
Points are transformed by multiplying each one of their coordinates by the
corresponding scale factor for the dimension.  Vectors are transformed as
points.  Covariant vectors are transformed by \emph{dividing} their components
by the scale factor in the corresponding dimension.  &
Same as the input space dimension. &
The $i$-th parameter represents the scaling in the $i$-th dimension. &
Only defined when the input and output space have the same number of dimensions. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\itkcaption[Scale Transform Characteristics]{Characteristics of the ScaleTransform class.
\label{tab:ScaleTransformCharacteristics}}
\end{table}

The \doxygen{ScaleTransform} represents a simple scaling of the
vector space.  Different scaling factors can be applied along each
dimension. Points are transformed by multiplying each one of their
coordinates by the corresponding scale factor for the dimension.  Vectors are
transformed in the same way as points.  Covariant vectors, on the other hand,
are transformed differently since anisotropic scaling does not preserve
angles. Covariant vectors are transformed by \emph{dividing} their components
by the scale factor of the corresponding dimension. In this way, if a
covariant vector was orthogonal to a vector, this orthogonality will be
preserved after the transformation. The following equations summarize the
effect of the transform on the basic geometric objects.

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lccccccc}
\mbox{Point }          & \bf{P'} &  =  & T(\bf{P})  & : & \bf{P'}_i &  = & \bf{P}_i \cdot S_i \\
\mbox{Vector}          & \bf{V'} &  =  & T(\bf{V})  & : & \bf{V'}_i &  = & \bf{V}_i \cdot S_i \\
\mbox{CovariantVector} & \bf{C'} &  =  & T(\bf{C})  & : & \bf{C'}_i &  = & \bf{C}_i /     S_i \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

where $\bf{P}_i$, $\bf{V}_i$ and $\bf{C}_i$ are the point, vector and covariant
vector $i$-th components while $\bf{S}_i$ is the scaling factor along dimension
$i-th$.  The following equation illustrates the effect of the scaling transform
on a $3D$ point.

\begin{equation}
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x' \\
y' \\
z' \\
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
S_1 &  0  &  0  \\
 0  & S_2 &  0  \\
 0  &  0  & S_3 \\
\end{array}
\right]
\cdot
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x  \\
y  \\
z  \\
\end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}

Scaling appears to be a simple transformation but there are actually a
number of issues to keep in mind when using different scale factors along
every dimension. There are subtle effects---for example, when computing image
derivatives. Since derivatives are represented by covariant vectors, their
values are not intuitively modified by scaling transforms.

One of the difficulties with managing scaling transforms in a registration
process is that typical optimizers manage the parameter space as a vector
space where addition is the basic operation. Scaling is better treated in the
frame of a logarithmic space where additions result in regular multiplicative
increments of the scale. Gradient descent optimizers have trouble updating
step length, since the effect of an additive increment on a scale factor
diminishes as the factor grows. In other words, a scale factor variation of
$(1.0+ \epsilon)$ is quite different from a scale variation of
$(5.0+\epsilon)$.

Registrations involving scale transforms require careful monitoring of the
optimizer parameters in order to keep it progressing at a stable pace. Note
that some of the transforms discussed in following sections, for example, the
AffineTransform, have hidden scaling parameters and are therefore
subject to the same vulnerabilities of the ScaleTransform.

In cases involving misalignments with simultaneous translation, rotation and
scaling components it may be desirable to solve for these components
independently. The main characteristics of the scale transform are presented in
Table~\ref{tab:ScaleTransformCharacteristics}.


\subsection{Scale Logarithmic Transform}
\label{sec:ScaleLogarithmicTransform}
\index{itk::Scale\-Logarithmic\-Transform}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{1.8cm} | p{2.5cm} | p{4cm} |}

\hline\hline

The $i$-th parameter represents the scaling in the $i$-th dimension. &

to the one of a Vector space.  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\itkcaption[Scale Logarithmic Transform Characteristics]{Characteristics of the ScaleLogarithmicTransform class.
\label{tab:ScaleLogarithmicTransformCharacteristics}}
\end{table}

The \doxygen{ScaleLogarithmicTransform} is a simple variation of the
\doxygen{ScaleTransform}. It is intended to improve the behavior of the scaling
parameters when they are modified by optimizers. The difference between this
transform and the ScaleTransform is that the parameter factors are passed here
as logarithms. In this way, multiplicative variations in the scale become
additive variations in the logarithm of the scaling factors.




\subsection{Euler2DTransform}
\label{sec:Euler2DTransform}
\index{itk::Euler2DTransform}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{1.8cm} | p{2.5cm} | p{4cm} |}
\hline
\textbf{Behavior} &
\textbf{Number of Parameters} &

Only defined for two-dimensional input and output spaces. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\itkcaption[Euler2D Transform Characteristics]{Characteristics of the Euler2DTransform class.
\label{tab:Euler2DTransformCharacteristics}}
\end{table}

\doxygen{Euler2DTransform} implements a rigid transformation in $2D$. It is
composed of a plane rotation and a two-dimensional translation. The rotation
is applied first, followed by the translation. The following equation
illustrates the effect of this transform on a $2D$ point,


\begin{equation}
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x' \\
y' \\
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} \\
\sin{\theta} &  \cos{\theta} \\
\end{array}
\right]
\cdot
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x  \\
y  \\
\end{array}
\right]
+
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
T_x  \\
T_y  \\
\end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ is the rotation angle and $(T_x,T_y)$ are the components of the
translation.

A challenging aspect of this transformation is the fact that translations and
rotations do not form a vector space and cannot be managed as linearly
independent parameters. Typical optimizers make the loose assumption that
parameters exist in a vector space and rely on the step length to be small
enough for this assumption to hold approximately.

In addition to the non-linearity of the parameter space, the most common
difficulty found when using this transform is the difference in units used
for rotations and translations. Rotations are measured in radians; hence,
their values are in the range $[-\pi,\pi]$. Translations are measured in
millimeters and their actual values vary depending on the image modality
being considered. In practice, translations have values on the order of $10$
to $100$. This scale difference between the rotation and translation
parameters is undesirable for gradient descent optimizers because they
deviate from the trajectories of descent and make optimization slower and more
unstable. In order to compensate for these differences, ITK optimizers accept
an array of scale values that are used to normalize the parameter space.

Registrations involving angles and translations should take advantage of the
scale normalization functionality in order to obtain the best performance out
of the optimizers. The main characteristics of the Euler2DTransform class
are presented in Table~\ref{tab:Euler2DTransformCharacteristics}.


\subsection{CenteredRigid2DTransform}
\label{sec:CenteredRigid2DTransform}
\index{itk::Centered\-Rigid2D\-Transform}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{1.8cm} | p{2.5cm} | p{4cm} |}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\itkcaption[CenteredRigid2D Transform Characteristics]{Characteristics of the CenteredRigid2DTransform class.
\label{tab:CenteredRigid2DTransformCharacteristics}}
\end{table}

\doxygen{CenteredRigid2DTransform} implements a rigid transformation in $2D$.
The main difference between this transform and the \doxygen{Euler2DTransform}
is that here we can specify an arbitrary center of rotation, while the
Euler2DTransform always uses the origin of the coordinate system as the center
of rotation. This distinction is quite important in image registration since
ITK images usually have their origin in the corner of the image rather than the
middle.  Rotational mis-registrations usually exist, however, as rotations
around the center of the image, or at least as rotations around a point in the
middle of the anatomical structure captured by the image. Using gradient
descent optimizers, it is almost impossible to solve non-origin rotations using
a transform with origin rotations since the deep basin of the real solution is
usually located across a high ridge in the topography of the cost function.

In practice, the user must supply the center of rotation in the input space,
the angle of rotation and a translation to be applied after the rotation. With
these parameters, the transform initializes a rotation matrix and a translation
vector that together perform the equivalent of translating the center of
rotation to the origin of coordinates, rotating by the specified angle,
translating back to the center of rotation and finally translating by the
user-specified vector.

As with the Euler2DTransform, this transform suffers from the difference in
units used for rotations and translations. Rotations are measured in radians;
hence, their values are in the range $[-\pi,\pi]$. The center of rotation and
the translations are measured in millimeters, and their actual values vary
depending on the image modality being considered.  Registrations involving
angles and translations should take advantage of the scale normalization
functionality of the optimizers in order to get the best performance out of
them.

The following equation illustrates the effect of the transform on an input
point $(x,y)$ that maps to the output point $(x',y')$,

\begin{equation}
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x' \\
y' \\
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} \\
\sin{\theta} &  \cos{\theta} \\
\end{array}
\right]
\cdot
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x - C_x \\

\end{array}
\right]
+
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
T_x + C_x \\
T_y + C_y \\
\end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ is the rotation angle, $(C_x,C_y)$ are the coordinates of the
rotation center and $(T_x,T_y)$ are the components of the translation. Note
that the center coordinates are subtracted before the rotation and added back
after the rotation. The main features of the CenteredRigid2DTransform are
presented in Table~\ref{tab:CenteredRigid2DTransformCharacteristics}.

\end{table}

The \doxygen{Similarity2DTransform} can be seen as a rigid transform combined
with an isotropic scaling factor. This transform preserves angles between
lines. In its $2D$ implementation, the four parameters of this transformation
combine the characteristics of the \doxygen{ScaleTransform} and
\doxygen{Euler2DTransform}. In particular, those relating to the non-linearity
of the parameter space and the non-uniformity of the measurement units.
Gradient descent optimizers should be used with caution on such parameter
spaces since the notions of gradient direction and step length are ill-defined.

The following equation illustrates the effect of the transform on an input
point $(x,y)$ that maps to the output point $(x',y')$,

where $\lambda$ is the scale factor, $\theta$ is the rotation angle,
$(C_x,C_y)$ are the coordinates of the rotation center and $(T_x,T_y)$ are the
components of the translation. Note that the center coordinates are subtracted
before the rotation and scaling, and they are added back afterwards.  The main
features of the Similarity2DTransform are presented in
Table~\ref{tab:Similarity2DTransformCharacteristics}.


A possible approach for controlling optimization in the parameter space of
this transform is to dynamically modify the array of scales passed to the
optimizer. The effect produced by the parameter scaling can be used to steer
the walk in the parameter space (by giving preference to some of the
parameters over others). For example, perform some iterations updating only
the rotation angle, then balance the array of scale factors in the optimizer
and perform another set of iterations updating only the translations.

Represents a $3D$ rotation and a $3D$ translation. The rotation is specified as a
quaternion, defined by a set of four numbers $\bf{q}$.  The relationship
between quaternion and rotation about vector $\bf{n}$ by angle $\theta$ is as

\end{table}

The \doxygen{QuaternionRigidTransform} class implements a rigid
transformation in $3D$ space. The rotational part of the transform is
represented using a quaternion while the translation is represented with a
vector. Quaternions components do not form a vector space and hence raise the
same concerns as the \doxygen{Similarity2DTransform} when used with gradient
descent optimizers.

The \doxygen{QuaternionRigidTransformGradientDescentOptimizer} was introduced into the toolkit to address these concerns.  This specialized optimizer implements a variation of a
gradient descent algorithm adapted for a quaternion space.  This class
ensures that after advancing in any direction on the parameter space, the
resulting set of transform parameters is mapped back into the permissible
set of parameters. In practice, this comes down to normalizing the newly-computed quaternion to make sure that the transformation remains rigid and no
scaling is applied.  The main characteristics of the
QuaternionRigidTransform are presented in
Table~\ref{tab:QuaternionRigidTransformCharacteristics}.

The Quaternion rigid transform also accepts a user-defined center of rotation.
In this way, the transform can easily be used for registering images where the
rotation is mostly relative to the center of the image instead of one of the
corners. The coordinates of this rotation center are not subject to
optimization. They only participate in the computation of the mappings for
Points and in the computation of the Jacobian. The transformations for Vectors
and CovariantVector are not affected by the selection of the rotation center.

By definition, a \emph{Versor} is the rotational part of a Quaternion. It can
also be defined as a \emph{unit-quaternion} \cite{Hamilton1866,Joly1905}.
Versors only have three independent components, since they are restricted to
reside in the space of unit-quaternions. The implementation of versors in the
toolkit uses a set of three numbers.  These three numbers correspond to the
first three components of a quaternion.  The fourth component of the quaternion
is computed internally such that the quaternion is of unit length. The main
characteristics of the \doxygen{VersorTransform} are presented in
Table~\ref{tab:VersorTransformCharacteristics}.

This transform exclusively represents rotations in $3D$. It is intended to
rapidly solve the rotational component of a more general misalignment.  The
efficiency of this transform comes from using a parameter space of reduced
dimensionality. Versors are the best possible representation for rotations in
$3D$ space. Sequences of versors allow the creation of smooth rotational
trajectories; for this reason, they behave stably under optimization methods.

The space formed by versor parameters is not a vector space. Standard gradient
descent algorithms are not appropriate for exploring this parameter space. An
optimizer specialized for the versor space is available in the toolkit under
the name of \doxygen{VersorTransformOptimizer}. This optimizer implements
versor derivatives as originally defined by Hamilton \cite{Hamilton1866}.

The center of rotation can be specified by the user with the
\code{SetCenter()} method. The center is not part of the parameters to be
optimized, therefore it remains the same during an optimization process. Its
value is used during the computations for transforming Points and when
computing the Jacobian.

The \doxygen{VersorRigid3DTransform} implements a rigid transformation in $3D$
space. It is a variant of the \doxygen{QuaternionRigidTransform} and the
\doxygen{VersorTransform}. It can be seen as a \doxygen{VersorTransform} plus a
translation defined by a vector. The advantage of this class with respect to
the QuaternionRigidTransform is that it exposes only six parameters, three for
the versor components and three for the translational components. This reduces
the search space for the optimizer to six dimensions instead of the seven
dimensional used by the QuaternionRigidTransform.  This transform also allows
the users to set a specific center of rotation. The center coordinates are not
modified during the optimization performed in a registration process.  The main
features of this transform are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:VersorRigid3DTransformCharacteristics}.  This transform is
probably the best option to use when dealing with rigid transformations in
$3D$.

Given that the space of Versors is not a Vector space, typical gradient descent
optimizers are not well suited for exploring the parametric space of this
transform. The \doxygen{VersorRigid3DTranformOptimizer} has been
introduced in the ITK toolkit with the purpose of providing an optimizer that
is aware of the Versor space properties on the rotational part of this
transform, as well as the Vector space properties on the translational part of
the transform.

The \doxygen{Euler3DTransform} implements a rigid transformation in $3D$ space.
It can be seen as a rotation followed by a translation. This class exposes six
parameters, three for the Euler angles that represent the rotation and three
for the translational components. This transform also allows the users to set a
specific center of rotation. The center coordinates are not modified during the
optimization performed in a registration process. The main features of this
transform are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:Euler3DTransformCharacteristics}.

Three rotational parameters are non-linear and do not behave
like Vector spaces. This must be taken into account when selecting an optimizer to
work with this transform and when fine tuning the parameters of the
optimizer. It is strongly recommended to use this transform by introducing very
small variations on the rotational components. A small rotation will be in the
range of 1 degree, which in radians is approximately $0.01745$.

You should not expect this transform to be able to compensate for large
rotations just by being driven with the optimizer. In practice you must provide
a reasonable initialization of the transform angles and only need to correct
for residual rotations in the order of $10$ or $20$ degrees.

The scaling and rotational spaces are non-linear and do not

The \doxygen{Rigid3DPerspectiveTransform} implements a rigid transformation in
$3D$ space followed by a perspective projection. This transform is intended to
be used in $3D/2D$ registration problems where a 3D object is projected onto a
2D plane. This is the case in Fluoroscopic images used for image-guided
intervention, and it is also the case for classical radiography.  Users must
provide a value for the focal distance to be used during the computation of the
perspective transform. This transform also allows users to set a specific
center of rotation. The center coordinates are not modified during the

Table~\ref{tab:Rigid3DPerspectiveTransformCharacteristics}.  This transform is also
used when creating Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs).

The strategies for optimizing the parameters of this transform are the same
ones used for optimizing the VersorRigid3DTransform. In particular, you can use
the same Versor\-Rigid3D\-Tranform\-Optimizer in order to optimize the

The first $N \times N$ parameters define the matrix in column-major order

\itkcaption[Affine Transform Characteristics]{Characteristics of the AffineTransform class.
\label{tab:AffineTransformCharacteristics}}
\end{table}

The \doxygen{AffineTransform} is one of the most popular transformations used
for image registration. Its main advantage comes from its representation as a
linear transformation. The main features of this
transform are presented in Table~\ref{tab:AffineTransformCharacteristics}.

The set of AffineTransform coefficients can actually be represented in a vector
space of dimension $(N+1) \times N$. This makes it possible for optimizers to
be used appropriately on this search space. However, the high dimensionality of
the search space also implies a high computational complexity of cost-function
derivatives. The best compromise in the reduction of this computational time is
to use the transform's Jacobian in combination with the image gradient for
computing the cost-function derivatives.

The coefficients of the $N \times N$ matrix can represent rotations,
anisotropic scaling and shearing. These coefficients are usually of a very
different dynamic range compared to the translation
coefficients. Coefficients in the matrix tend to be in the range $[-1:1]$, but
are not restricted to this interval.  Translation coefficients, on the other
hand, can be on the order of $10$ to $100$, and are basically related to the
image size and pixel spacing.

This difference in scale makes it necessary to take advantage of the
functionality offered by the optimizers for rescaling the parameter space. This
is particularly relevant for optimizers based on gradient descent approaches.
This transform lets the user set an arbitrary center of rotation. The
coordinates of the rotation center do not make part of the parameters array
passed to the optimizer. Equation~\ref{eqn:AffineTransform} illustrates the
effect of applying the AffineTransform to a point in $3D$ space.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:AffineTransform}
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x' \\
y' \\
z' \\
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
M_{00} & M_{01} & M_{02} \\
M_{10} & M_{11} & M_{12} \\
M_{20} & M_{21} & M_{22} \\
\end{array}
\right]
\cdot
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x - C_x \\
y - C_y \\
z - C_z \\
\end{array}
\right]
+
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
T_x + C_x \\
T_y + C_y \\
T_z + C_z \\
\end{array}
\right]
\end{equation}


A registration based on the affine transform may be more effective when
applied after simpler transformations have been used to remove the major
components of misalignment. Otherwise it will incur an overwhelming
computational cost. For example, using an affine transform, the first set of
optimization iterations would typically focus on removing large
translations. This task could instead be accomplished by a translation
transform in a parameter space of size $N$ instead of the $(N+1) \times N$
associated with the affine transform.

Tracking the evolution of a registration process that uses
AffineTransforms can be challenging, since it is difficult to
represent the coefficients in a meaningful way.  A simple printout of the
transform coefficients generally does not offer a clear picture of the current
behavior and trend of the optimization.  A better implementation uses
the affine transform to deform a wire-frame cube which is shown in a $3D$
visualization display.

\end{table}

The \doxygen{BSplineDeformableTransform} is designed to be used for solving
deformable registration problems. This transform is equivalent to generating a
deformation field where a deformation vector is assigned to every point in
space.  The deformation vectors are computed using BSpline interpolation from
the deformation values of points located in a coarse grid, which is usually
referred to as the BSpline grid.

The BSplineDeformableTransform is not flexible enough to account for large
rotations or shearing, or scaling differences. In order to compensate for this
limitation, it provides the functionality of being composed with an arbitrary
transform. This transform is known as the \emph{Bulk} transform and it
applied to points before they are mapped with the displacement field.

This transform does not provide functionality for mapping Vectors nor
CovariantVectors---only Points can be mapped. This is because the variations
of a vector under a deformable transform actually depend on the location of the
vector in space. In other words, Vectors only make sense as the relative
position between two points.

The BSplineDeformableTransform has a very large number of parameters and
therefore is well suited for the \doxygen{LBFGSOptimizer} and
\doxygen{LBFGSBOptimizer}. The use of this transform was proposed in the
following papers~\cite{Rueckert1999,Mattes2001,Mattes2003}.

Kernel Transforms are a set of Transforms that are also suitable for performing
deformable registration. These transforms compute on-the-fly the displacements
corresponding to a deformation field. The displacement values corresponding to
every point in space are computed by interpolation from the vectors defined by
a set of \emph{Source Landmarks} and a set of \emph{Target Landmarks}.

Several variations of these transforms are available in the toolkit. They
differ in the type of interpolation kernel that is used when computing the
deformation in a particular point of space. Note that these transforms are
computationally expensive and that their numerical complexity is proportional
to the number of landmarks and the space dimension.

The following is the list of Transforms based on the KernelTransform.

\emph{et. al}~\cite{Rohr1999,Rohr2001}.
