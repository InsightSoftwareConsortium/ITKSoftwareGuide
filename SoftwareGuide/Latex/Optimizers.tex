Optimization algorithms are encapsulated as \doxygen{ObjectToObjectOptimizer}
objects within ITKv4. Optimizers are generic and can be used for applications
other than registration. Within the registration framework, subclasses of
\doxygen{SingleValuedNonLinearVnlOptimizerv4} are implemented as a wrap
around already implemented vnl classes.

\index{itk::ObjectToObjectOptimizer!SetMetric()}
\index{itk::ObjectToObjectOptimizer!StartOptimization()}
\index{itk::ObjectToObjectOptimizer!GetCurrentPosition()}

The basic input to an optimizer is a cost function or metric object. In the context
of registration, \doxygen{ImageToImageMetricv4} classes provide this functionality.
The metric is set using \code{SetInitialPosition()} and
the optimization algorithm is invoked by \code{StartOptimization()}.
Once the optimization has finished, the final parameters can be obtained
using \code{GetCurrentPosition()}.

\index{itk::ObjectToObjectOptimizer!SetScales()}
Some optimizers also allow rescaling of their individual parameters. This is
convenient for normalizing parameter spaces where some parameters have
different dynamic ranges. For example, the first parameter of
\doxygen{Euler2DTransform} represents an angle while the last two parameters
represent translations. A unit change in angle has a much greater impact on an
image than a unit change in translation. This difference in scale appears as
long narrow valleys in the search space making the optimization problem more
difficult. Rescaling the translation parameters can help to fix this problem.
Scales are represented as an \doxygen{Array} of doubles and set using
\code{SetScales()}.

\index{itk::ObjectToObjectOptimizer!SetScalesEstimator()}
Estimating the scales parameters can also be done automatically using the
\doxygen{OptimizerParameterScalesEstimatorTemplate} and its subclasses.
The scales estimator object is then set to the optimizer via
\code{SetScalesEstimator()}.

Despite the old version of ITK, there are only \emph{Single Valued} types
of optimizers available in ITKv4, which are suitable for dealing with cost
functions that return a single value. These are indeed the most common type
of cost functions, and are also known as \emph{Single Valued} functions.

The types of single valued optimizers currently available in ITKv4 are:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Amoeba}: Nelder-Meade downhill simplex.  This optimizer is
actually implemented in the \code{vxl/vnl} numerics toolkit.  The ITK class
\doxygen{AmoebaOptimizerv4} is merely an adaptor class.

\item \textbf{Gradient Descent}: Advances parameters in the direction of the
gradient where the step size is governed by a learning rate
(\doxygen{GradientDescentOptimizerv4}).

\item \textbf{Gradient Descent Line Search}: Gradient descent with a golden
section line search. \doxygen{GradientDescentLineSearchOptimizerv4} implements
a simple gradient descent optimizer that is followed by a line search to find
the best value for the learning rate.

\item \textbf{Conjugate Gradient Descent Line Search}: Advances parameters in
the direction of the Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient where a line search is
used to find the best value for the learning rate
(\doxygen{ConjugateGradientLineSearchOptimizerv4}).

\item \textbf{Quasi Newton}: Implements a Quasi-Newton optimizer with BFGS
Hessian estimation. Second order approximation of the cost function is usually
more efficient since it estimates the descent or ascent direction more precisely.
However, computation of Hessian is usually expensive or unavailable. Alternatively
Quasi-Newton methods can estimate a Hessian from the gradients in previous steps.
Here a specific Quasi-Newton method, BFGS, is used to compute the Quasi-Newton steps
(\doxygen{QuasiNewtonOptimizerv4}).

\item \textbf{LBFGS}: Limited memory Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb
and Shannon minimization. It is an adaptor to an optimizer in \code{vnl}
(\doxygen{LBFGSOptimizerv4}).

\item \textbf{LBFGSB}: A modified version of the LBFGS optimizer that allows to
specify bounds for the parameters in the search space.  It is an adaptor to an
optimizer in \code{netlib}. Details on this optimizer can be found
in~\cite{Byrd1995,Zhu1997} (\doxygen{LBFGSBOptimizerv4}).

\item \textbf{One Plus One Evolutionary}: Strategy that simulates the
biological evolution of a set of samples in the search space. This optimizer is
mainly used in the process of bias correction of MRI images
(\doxygen{OnePlusOneEvolutionaryOptimizerv4}). Details on this optimizer can be
found in~\cite{Styner2000}.

\item \textbf{Regular Step Gradient Descent}: Advances parameters in the
direction of the gradient where a bipartition scheme is used to compute
the step size (\doxygen{RegularStepGradientDescentOptimizerv4}).
This optimizer is also used for Versor transforms parameters, where the
current rotation is composed with the gradient rotation to produce the
new rotation versor. The translational part of the transform parameters
are updated as usually done in a vector space. It follows the definition
of versor gradients defined by Hamilton~\cite{Hamilton1866}

\item \textbf{Powell Optimizer}: Powell optimization method.  For an
N-dimensional parameter space, each iteration minimizes(maximizes) the function
in N (initially orthogonal) directions. This optimizer is described
in~\cite{Press1992}.  (\doxygen{PowellOptimizerv4}).

\item \textbf{Exhausive Optimizer}: Fully samples a grid on the parameteric space.
This optimizer is equivalent to an exahaustive search in a discrete grid defined
over the parametric space. The grid is centered on the initial position. The
subdivisions of the grid along each one of the dimensions of the parametric space
is defined by an array of number of steps
(\doxygen{ExhaustiveOptimizerv4}).

\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:Optimizersv4Hierarchy} illustrates the full class hierarchy of
optimizers in ITK. Optimizers in the lower right corner are adaptor classes
to optimizers existing in the \code{vxl/vnl} numerics toolkit. The optimizers
interact with the \doxygen{CostFunction} class. In the registration framework
this cost function is reimplemented in the form of ImageToImageMetric.
